Repository of MATLAB code related to manuscript: B.Wang, A.V.Peterchev, and S.M.Goetz, Analysis and Comparison of Methods for Determining Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Thresholds, 2022

Folder "Statistical-MEP-Model" is updated version of code from repository: https://github.com/sgoetzduke/Statistical-MEP-Model

Folder "Functions" contains TMS thresholding methods and supporting functions and data.

Folder "DataStorage" contains .mat file (parameters of 25000 virtual subjects) and stores output data of TMS thresholding methods.

Example slurm files are provided to run TMS thresholding methods on a cluster. Modify paths and parameters as needed.
